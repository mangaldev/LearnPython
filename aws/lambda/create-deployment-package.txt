Open a command prompt and create a my-sourcecode-function project directory. For example, on macOS:

mkdir my-sourcecode-function
Navigate to the my-sourcecode-function project directory.

cd my-sourcecode-function
Copy the contents of the following sample Python code and save it in a new file named lambda_function.py:

import requests
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    response = requests.get("https://www.example.com/")
    print(response.text)
    return response.text
Your directory structure should look like this:

my-sourcecode-function$
| lambda_function.py
Install the requests library to a new package directory.

pip install --target ./package pymysql
Create a deployment package with the installed library at the root.

cd package
zip -r ../my-deployment-package.zip .
This generates a my-deployment-package.zip file in your project directory. The command produces the following output:

adding: chardet/ (stored 0%)
adding: chardet/enums.py (deflated 58%)
...
Add the lambda_function.py file to the root of the zip file.

cd ..
zip -g my-deployment-package.zip lambda_function.py
